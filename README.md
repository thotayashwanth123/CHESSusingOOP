# CHESSusingOOP
This project implements a classic version of Chess with a Graphical User Interface. It is a pure implementation of the Object Oriented Programming (OOP) paradigms and concepts. The Chess game follows the basic rules of chess, and all the chess pieces only move according to valid moves for that piece. Our implementation of Chess is for two players (Artificial Intelligence is not included yet). It is played on an 8x8 checkered board, with a dark square in each player's lower left corner. We successfully created a GUI using inheritance and templates, as specified. Our Chess program is a great, user-friendly game for two players. It is a timed game and a player loses his right to move once he runs out of time.

This project was a part of Object Oriented Analysis and Design Course.

**Running the project**

The game can be run simply in NetBeans or Eclipse.

**Features**

1. GUI build using _Java Swing_.
2. Various _Event handlers_ are implemented.
3. _Greedy Approach_ is used to determine if a move results for a _checkmate_ (win or loss).

**Implementation**

The project consists of a Chess package which has all the java files. Code execution begins from the ChessGame class.
